# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## Rafael Amauri


I'm passionate about Computer Vision, Linux, Image Processing, and AI. Most of the software I've written relates to one or more of these topics in some way. 😁

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at UFMG, focusing on **Deep Active Learning for Recognition in Video**.


#### Personal Projects 🚀

I'm always eager to learn new things. You can check out my [Projects Repo](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Projects), where I try to keep an updated record of what I'm working on.

Here are some of my personal projects:

#### * [Image Studio](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Image-Studio)
    
This is my favorite project by far! **Image Studio** is a space where I experiment with coding various image processing techniques by hand, implementing things I find interesting in the field.

#### * [Tree](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Tree)
    
An implementation of the ```tree``` command in pure C. What makes it interesting is that it avoids any recursion, instead using a custom linked stack to list directory contents. This improves performance and reduces resource usage.

#### * [Kernel Updater](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Kernel-Updater)

Kernel Updater is a project that automatically downloads, compiles and installs any version of the Linux kernel. It was made as a way for me to learn basic bash scripting.
