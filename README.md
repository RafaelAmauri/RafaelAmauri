## Rafael


I'm passionate about Image Processing, Computer Vision, Linux, and AI. Most of the software I've written relates to one or more of these topics in some way. üòÅ

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at UFMG, focusing on **Deep Active Learning for Continuous Sign Language Recognition**.


### Personal Projects üöÄ

I'm always eager to learn new things. You can check out my [Projects Repo](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Projects), where I try to keep an updated record of what I'm working on.

Here are some of my personal projects:

####  ‚Ä¢ [Image Studio](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Image-Studio)
    
This is my favorite project by far! **Image Studio** is where I challenge myself to implement image processing algorithms that I find interesting without the help of external image processing libraries. Everything in this repo is either pure Numpy or C-like Cython code.

#### ‚Ä¢ [Tree](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Tree)
    
An implementation of the ```tree``` command in pure C. What makes it interesting is that it avoids any recursion, instead using a custom linked stack to list directory contents. This improves performance and reduces resource usage. The program also only utilizes the C standard library, which makes it extremely portable and lightweight.

#### ‚Ä¢ [Kernel Updater](https://github.com/RafaelAmauri/Kernel-Updater)

**Kernel Updater** is a script that automatically downloads, compiles, and installs any version of the Linux kernel. I built this project as a way to learn the basics of Bash scripting.
